Daisy
================================================================================

*Daisy* is a minimalistic FORTH-like language kernel. It is developed primairly
as an excercise in -- lacking other words to express that -- *particular coding
style* that interests me. Potentially, this may be developed into a well-rounded
system for programming. Standard library is ahead. Userspace-implemented
compilation is ahead.
